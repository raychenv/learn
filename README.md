From programming view of point, learning is tree traversing from 
overview or architecture of something as its root to all leaves 
recursively. By this way, we can see the full picture of the tree 
and its beauty inside.

This is a **_personal white-board_** where I *scribble* anything,
*organize* my code, learning experiences.

## C++

> C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages
> in the world. Well-written C++ programs are fast and efficient.
> The language is more flexible than other languages because you
> can use it to create a wide range of apps—from fun and exciting
> games, to high-performance scientific software, to device drivers,
> embedded programs, and Windows client apps. For more than 20 years,
> C++ has been used to solve problems like these and many others.

## Python

Python is probably fast enough for many of what we need to do today.
And it's relatively easy to learn and use, with rich ecosystems in
data science, web frameworks, scripting, and many others.

## Java

> Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, 
> class-based, object-oriented,and specifically designed to have as few 
> implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application 
> developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java 
> code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for 
> recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that 
> can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

## Design Pattern

> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution 
> to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is 
> not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. 
> It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many 
> different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the 
> programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
